### What is this?

Real-Estate selling is a very niche market. For this reason, Realtor's typically specialize 
on specific markets. But that presents challenges, due to this specialization they can run into issues when they try 
to sell a home outside of their specialized area because they may not know the area as well as they should.

The **Near Home** application allows Realtors to familiarize themselves with an unknown market relatively quick. 
**Near Home** will provide immediate information on near by resources and attractions such as Schools, Parks, 
Restaurants and Shopping Information. By leveraging **Near Home**, Realtors will be able to expand their selling 
opportunities and service more future homeowners.
