### What is this?

Real-Estate selling is a very niche market. For this reason, Realtor's typically specialize 
on specific markets. But that presents challenges, because due to this specialization 
they can run into challenges when they try to sell a home outside of their specialized area.  

This application allows Realtors to familiarize themselves with attractions and resources
available around a particular address quickly. It provides immediate information on near by 
resources and attractions such as Schools, Parks, Restaurants and Shopping Information.
