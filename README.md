### What is this?

Real-Estate selling is a very niche market. For this reason, Realtor's typically specialize 
on specific markets. But that presents challenges, due to this specialization they can run into issues when they try to sell a home outside of their specialized area.  

This application allows Realtors to familiarize themselves with attractions and resources
available, to the future homeowner, around a specific address. It provides immediate information on near by 
resources and attractions such as Schools, Parks, Restaurants and Shopping Information.
